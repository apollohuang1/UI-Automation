    "[Scrollable] This UI snippet is from the Twitter mobile application. The main screen consists of a toolbar at the top that includes the Twitter logo, a navigation drawer button, and a compose tweet button. Below the toolbar is a ViewPager with two tabs labeled \"For You\" and \"Following\". These tabs allow users to switch between their personalized and followed Twitter feeds, respectively. Each tab consists of a RecyclerView displaying a list of tweets that include the primary photo, username, tweet content, views, and engagement icons like reply, retweet, like, and share. At the bottom of the screen, there is a tab bar that includes icons for search and explore, spaces, notifications, and messages. Overall, this UI allows users to navigate through their Twitter feeds quickly and efficiently while also providing access to key features of the application."
